    "# Thoughts on pip integration in FreeCAD\n",
    "\n",
    "find a way to to integrate pip-support in freecad which works with all builds. Mostly this means finding a compromise which works for bundles and for system versions of FreeCAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. app / gui\n",
    "providing a simple way to install packages from the command line is the first step. Once we figure out a way that works for all builds we can extend this to gui-functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. api design\n",
    "make the api-design as simple as possible and similar to pip command-line-tool\n",
    "\n",
    "3. --user flag\n",
    "As we cannot and don't want to install to any root directories we are forced to use the --user flag. This will install to a local directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. support different directories\n",
    "This will give the opportunity to select between different dependency-trees, try out new things,.. without the need to reinstall freecad. (Similar to what environments provide for systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. constraint file\n",
    "The constraint file provides a method to install stuff in a more secure (stable) way. In bundles and system-installation of freecad, there are some packages already preinstalled. To not mess with these packages and introduce incompabilities we should constraint this packages to there installed versions. This way pip will not update any of the constraint packages. For example this file can be created everytime the freecad.pip package is imported. All packages which are not part of the user site package or a custom site package are listed in this constraint file.\n",
    "It would be also nice to add additional constraints to this file. But currently I am not sure how to acchieve this.\n",
